# Bayesian Modeling to predict Dengue Incidence Rate through socio-environmental deficiency index

In this project, we explored using Bayesian Model in order to predict the chances of a county have high incidences of dengue fever.

We want to be able to accomplish:
- Create a  socio-envorinmental deficiency index
- How likely a county to have high dengue incidence rate?
- Experimenting of variables selection techniques.
- Explorations of the variables so serves as a good example of Exploratory Data Analysis and how that can guide the model creation and selection process.

## The Data:

It is a public dataset contains the numbers of dengue cases for which county of Alagoas between 2007 and 2017, the estimated popultation and variables about the proportion of households with disabilities in indices such as urban cleanliness, sanitary sewage, household income and study.
